# Usage

*TinyExpr++* is a formula-solving library which accepts math and logic expressions such as:

```cpp
ABS(((5+2) / (ABS(-2))) * -9 + 2) - 5^2
```

Applications using *TinyExpr++* may provide context-specific variables
that you can use in your expressions. For example, in a spreadsheet application, values representing cells such as `C1` and `D2` may be available. This would enable the use of expressions such as:

```cpp
SUM(C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, D3)
```

As another example, in a statistical program, the values `N_OBS` and
`P_LEVEL` may be available. This would make an expression such as this possible:

```cpp
IF(AND(P_LEVEL < .05, N_OBS >= 30),
   P_LEVEL,
   NAN)
```

Please consult your application's documentation for which custom
variables and functions it may provide for its formulas.
