# Building

*TinyExpr++* is self-contained in two files: `tinyexpr.cpp` and `tinyexpr.h`. To use
*TinyExpr++*, add those two files to your project.

The API documentation can be built using the following:

```
doxygen docs/Doxyfile
```

## Requirements {-}

*TinyExpr++* must be compiled as C++17.

MSVC, GCC, and Clang compilers are supported.
