# About

This is the reference manual for TinyExpr++, the C++ version of the TinyExpr formula parsing library.

TinyExpr++ is a small parser and evaluation library for solving math expressions from C++.
It's open-source, free, easy-to-use, and self-contained in a single source and header file pair.
