# How it Works

`te_parser::evaluate()` uses a simple recursive descent parser to compile your
expression into a syntax tree. For example, the expression `"sin x + 1/4"`
parses as:

`te_parser::evaluate()` also automatically prunes constant branches. In this example,
the compiled expression returned by `te_compile()` would become:

## Speed

TinyExpr++ is fairly fast compared to C when the expression is short, when the
expression does hard calculations (e.g., exponentiation), and when some of the
work can be simplified by `evaluate()`. TinyExpr++ is slow compared to C when the
expression is long and involves only basic arithmetic.

Here are some example benchmarks:

| Expression | evaluate time | native C time | slowdown  |
| :------------- |-------------:| -----:|----:|
| sqrt(a^1.5+a^2.5) | 1,707 ns | 58.25 ns | 29% slower |
| a+5 | 535 ns | 0.67 ns | 798% slower |
| a+(5*2) | 0.73 ns | 969 ns | 1,327% slower |
| (a+5)*2 | 0.66 ns | 980 ns | 1,484% slower |
| (1/(a+1)+2/(a+2)+3/(a+3)) | 3,388 ns | 3.941 ns | 859%  slower |

Note that TinyExpr++ is slower compared to TinyExpr because of additional type safety checks.

## Grammar

TinyExpr++ parses the following grammar (from lowest-to-highest operator precedence):

    <list>      =    <expr> {(",", ";" [dependent on locale]) <expr>}
    <expr>      =    <term> {("&" | "|") <term>}
    <expr>      =    <term> {("<>" | "!=" | "=" | "<") | "<=") | ">" | ">=") <term>}
    <expr>      =    <term> {("<<" | ">>") <term>}
    <expr>      =    <term> {("+" | "-") <term>}
    <term>      =    <factor> {("*" | "/" | "%") <factor>}
    <factor>    =    <power> {("^" | "**") <power>}
    <power>     =    {("-" | "+")} <base>
    <base>      =    <constant>
                   | <variable>
                   | <function-0> {"(" ")"}
                   | <function-1> <power>
                   | <function-X> "(" <expr> {"," <expr>} ")"
                   | "(" <list> ")"

In addition, whitespace between tokens is ignored.

Valid variable names consist of a lower-case letter followed by any combination
of: lower-case letters `a` through `z`, the digits `0` through `9`, and
underscore. Constants can be integers, decimal numbers, or in scientific
notation (e.g., `1e3` for `1000`). A leading zero is not required (e.g., `.5`
for `0.5`)
