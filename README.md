# TinyExpr++

TinyExpr++ is a C++ version of the TinyExpr library.

TinyExpr++ is a very small recursive descent parser and evaluation engine for
math expressions. It's handy when you want to add the ability to evaluation
math expressions at runtime without adding a bunch of cruft to your project.

In addition to the standard math operators and precedence, TinyExpr++ also supports
the standard C math functions and runtime binding of variables.

## Features

- **C++17 with no dependencies**.
- Single source file and header file.
- Simple and fast.
- Implements standard operators precedence.
- Implements logical and comparison operators.
- Exposes standard C math functions (sin, sqrt, ln, etc.), as well as some Excel-like functions (e.g., `AVERAGE()` and `IF()`).
- Can add custom functions and variables easily.
- Can bind constants at eval-time.
- Supports variadic functions (taking between 1-7 arguments).
- Case insensitive.
- Can support non-US formulas (e.g., "**pow(2,2; 2)**" instead of "**pow(2.2, 2)**").
- Released under the zlib license - free for nearly any use.
- Easy to use and integrate with your code
- Thread-safe, parser is in a self-contained object.

## Changes from TinyExpr

The following are changes from the original TinyExpr C library:

- Compiles as C++17 code.
- `te_*` functions are now wrapped in a `te_parser` class.
- `te_interp()`, `te_compile()`, and `te_eval()` have been replaced with `te_parser::compile()`, `te_parser::evaluate()`, and `te_parser::set_vars()`.
    `set_vars()` sets your list of custom functions and variables. `compile()` compiles and optimizes an expression.
    Finally, `evaluate()` will use the already compiled expression and return its result.
    `evaluate()` also has an overload that compiles and evaluates an expression in one call.
- Variable/function types (e.g., `TE_FUNCTION0`) have been removed; types are now deduced by the compiler. The available flags
  for variables and functions are now just combinations of `TE_DEFAULT`, `TE_PURE`, and `TE_VARIADIC`.
- Formula parsing is now case insensitive.
- Added support for variadic functions (can accept 1-7 arguments); enabled through the `TE_VARIADIC` flag.
  Refer to the `AVERAGE()` function in `tinyexp.cpp`.
- Added support for parsing formulas in non-US format (e.g., "**pow(2,2; 2)**" instead of "**pow(2.2, 2)**"). Useful for when the program's locale is non-English.
  Refer to `example4.cpp` for a demonstration.
- `te_expr` is now a derivable base class. This means that you can derive from `te_expr`, add new fields to that derived class (e.g., arrays, strings, even other classes)
  and then use a custom class as an argument to the various function types that accept a `te_expr*` parameter. The function that you connect can then `dynamic_cast<>`
  this argument and use its custom fields, thus greatly enhancing the functionality for these types of functions.
  Refer to the `te_expr_array` class in `smoke.cpp` for an example.
- Added exception support, where exceptions are thrown for situations like divide by zero. Calls to `compile` and `evaluate` should be wrapped in `try`...`catch` blocks.
- Memory management is handled by the `te_parser` class (you no longer need to call `te_free`). Also, replaced `malloc/free` with `new/delete`.
- Stricter type safety; uses `std::variant` (instead of unions) that support `double`, `const double*`, and 16 specific function pointer signatures.
  Also uses `std::initializer` lists (instead of various pointer operations).
- Separate enums are now used between `te_expr` and `state`'s types and are more strongly typed.
- Added new built-in functions:
  - `and`: returns true if all conditions are true (accepts 1-7 arguments).
  - `average`: returns the means for a range of values (accepts 1-7 arguments).
  - `cot`: returns the cotangent of an angle.
  - `combin`: alias for `ncr()`, like the **Excel** function.
  - `clamp`: contrains a value to a range.
  - `fact`: alias for `fac()`, like the **Excel** function.
  - `if`: if a value is true, then returns second value; otherwise, returns third.
  - `max`: returns the maximum of a range of values (accepts 1-7 arguments).
  - `min`: returns the minimum of a range of values (accepts 1-7 arguments).
  - `mod`: returns remainder from a division.
  - `or`: returns true if any condition is true (accepts 1-7 arguments).
  - `not`: returns logical negation of value.
  - `permut`: alias for `npr()`, like the **Excel** function.
  - `power`: alias for `pow()`, like the **Excel** function.
  - `rand`: returns random number between 0 and 1.
  - `round`: returns a number, rounded to a given decimal point. Decimal point is optional and defaults to 0.
  - `sign`: returns the sign of a number: 1 if positive, -1 if negative, 0 if zero.
  - `sum`: returns the sum of a list of values (accepts 1-7 arguments).
  - `sqr`: returns a number squared.
  - `trunc`: returns the integer part of a number.
- Added new operators:
  - `&`    logical AND.
  - `|`    logical OR.
  - `=`    equal to.
  - `<>`   not equal to.
  - `<`    less than.
  - `<=`   less than or equal to.
  - `>`    greater than.
  - `>=`   greater than or equal to.
- Custom variables and functions are now stored in a `std::vector` (which can be easily accessed and updated via the new `get_vars()/set_vars()` functions).
- Added `is_function_used()` and `is_variable_used()` functions to see if a specific function or variable was used in the last parsed formula.
- Added `set_constant()` function to find and update the value of a constant (custom) variable by name.
- Added `get_constant()` function to return the value of a constant (custom) variable by name.
- Binary search is now used to look up custom variables and functions (small optimization).
- You no longer need to specify the number of arguments for custom functions; it will deduce that for you.
- The position of an error when evaluating an expression is now managed by the `te_parser` class and accessible via `get_last_error_position()`.
- The position of aforementioned error is now 0-indexed (not 1-indexed); -1 indicates that there was no error.
- Added `success()` function to indicate if the last parse succeeded or not.
- Added `get_result()` function to get result from the last call to evaluate.
- Now uses `std::numeric_limits` for math constants (instead of macro constants).
- Replaced C-style casts with `static_cast<>`.
- Replaced all macros with `constexpr`s and lambdas.
- Replaced custom binary search used for built-in function searching with `std::lower_bound()`.
- Now uses `nullptr` (instead of 0).
- All data fields are now initialized.
- Added [Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) comments.
- Added assertions to verify that built-in and custom functions/variables are sorted.
- Added assertion to verify that there aren't any duplicate custom functions/variables.
- `te_print()` is now only available in debug builds.
- Added `[[nodiscard]]` attributes to improve compile-time warnings.
- Added `constexpr` and `noexcept` for C++ optimization.

## Building

TinyExpr++ is self-contained in two files: `tinyexpr.cpp` and `tinyexpr.h`. To use
TinyExpr++, simply add those two files to your project.

## Short Example

Here is a minimal example to evaluate an expression at runtime.

```cpp
    #include "tinyexpr.h"
    te_parser tep;
    const char* c = "sqrt(5^2+7^2+11^2+(8-2)^2)";
    const double r = tep.evaluate("sqrt(5^2+7^2+11^2+(8-2)^2)");
    printf("The expression:\n\t%s\nevaluates to:\n\t%f\n", c, r);
    // prints 15.198684
```

## Usage

TinyExpr++'s `te_parser` class defines these functions:

```cpp
    double evaluate(const char* expression);
    double get_result();
    bool success();
    int get_last_error_position();
    set_vars(const std::vector<te_variable>& vars);
    std::vector<te_variable>& get_vars();
    get_decimal_separator();
    get_list_separator();
```

`evaluate()` takes an expression and immediately returns the result of it. If there
is a parse error, it returns NaN.

`get_result()` can be called anytime afterwards to retrieve the result from `evaluate()`.

`success()` can be called to see if the previous call `evaluate()` succeeded or not.

If the parse failed, calling `get_last_error_position()` will return the 0-based index of where in the expression the parse failed.

**example usage:**

```cpp
    te_parser tep;

    double a = tep.evaluate("(5+5)"); /* Returns 10. */
    double b = tep.evaluate("(5+5)"); /* Returns 10, error is set to -1 (i.e., no error). */
    double c = tep.evaluate("(5+5");  /* Returns NaN, error is set to 3. */
```

Give `set_vars()` a list of constants, bound variables, and function pointers.

`evaluate()` will then evaluate expressions using these variables and functions.


**example usage:**

```cpp
    #include "tinyexpr.h"
    #include <stdio.h>

    double x{0}, y{0};
    // Store variable names and pointers.
    te_parser tep;
    tep.set_vars({{"x", &x}, {"y", &y}});

    // Compile the expression with variables.
    auot result = tep.evaluate("sqrt(x^2+y^2)");

    if (tep.success()) {
        x = 3; y = 4;
        const double h1 = tep.evaluate(); /* Will use the previously used expression, returns 5. */

        x = 5; y = 12;
        const double h2 = tep.evaluate(); /* Returns 13. */
    } else {
        printf("Parse error at %d\n", tep.get_last_error_position());
    }
```

## Longer Example

Here is a complete example that will evaluate an expression passed in from the command
line. It also does error checking and binds the variables `x` and `y` to *3* and *4*, respectively.

```cpp
    #include "tinyexpr.h"
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        if (argc < 2) {
            printf("Usage: example2 \"expression\"\n");
            return 0;
        }

        const char *expression = argv[1];
        printf("Evaluating:\n\t%s\n", expression);

        /* This shows an example where the variables
         * x and y are bound at eval-time. */
        double x{0}, y{0};
        // Store variable names and pointers.
        te_parser tep;
        tep.set_vars({{"x", &x}, {"y", &y}});

        /* This will compile the expression and check for errors. */
        auto result = tep.evaluate(expression);

        if (tep.success()) {
            /* The variables can be changed here, and eval can be called as many
             * times as you like. This is fairly efficient because the parsing has
             * already been done. */
            x = 3; y = 4;
            const double r = tep.evaluate();
            printf("Result:\n\t%f\n", r);
        } else {
            /* Show the user where the error is at. */
            printf("\t%*s^\nError near here",  tep.get_last_error_position(), "");
        }

        return 0;
    }
```


This produces the output:

    $ example2 "sqrt(x^2+y2)"
        Evaluating:
                sqrt(x^2+y2)
                          ^
        Error near here


    $ example2 "sqrt(x^2+y^2)"
        Evaluating:
                sqrt(x^2+y^2)
        Result:
                5.000000

## Binding to Custom Functions

TinyExpr++ can also call to custom functions implemented in C. Here is a short example:

```cpp
double my_sum(double a, double b) {
    /* Example C function that adds two numbers together. */
    return a + b;
}

te_parser tep;
tep.set_vars({
    {"mysum", my_sum, TE_FUNCTION2} /* TE_FUNCTION2 used because my_sum takes two arguments. */
};)

const double r = tep.evaluate("mysum(5, 6)");
```

## Non-US Formatted Formulas

TinyExpr++ supports other locales and non-US formatted formulas. Here is an example:

```cpp
#include "tinyexpr.h"
#include <cstdio>
#include <locale>
#include <clocale>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    /* Set locale to German.
       This string is platform dependent. The following works on Windows,
       consult your platform's documentation for more details.*/
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "de-DE");
    std::locale::global(std::locale("de-DE"));

    /* After setting your locale to German, functions like strtod() will fail
       with values like "3.14" because it expects "3,14" instead.
       To fix this, we will tell the parser to use "," as the decimal separator
       and ";" as list argument separator.*/

    const char *expression = "pow(2,2; 2)"; // instead of "pow(2.2, 2)"
    printf("Evaluating:\n\t%s\n", expression);

    te_parser tep;
    tep.set_decimal_separator(',');
    tep.set_list_separator(';');

    /* This will compile the expression and check for errors. */
    auto r = tep.evaluate(expression);

    if (tep.success()) {
        const double r = tep.evaluate(expression); printf("Result:\n\t%f\n", r);
    } else {
        /* Show the user where the error is at. */
        printf("\t%*s^\nError near here", tep.get_last_error_position(), "");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This produces the output:

    $ example4
      Evaluating:
        pow(2,2; 2)
      Result:
        4,840000

## How it works

`te_parser::evaluate()` uses a simple recursive descent parser to compile your
expression into a syntax tree. For example, the expression `"sin x + 1/4"`
parses as:

![example syntax tree](doc/e1.png?raw=true)

`te_parser::evaluate()` also automatically prunes constant branches. In this example,
the compiled expression returned by `te_compile()` would become:

![example syntax tree](doc/e2.png?raw=true)

## Speed

TinyExpr++ is fairly fast compared to C when the expression is short, when the
expression does hard calculations (e.g., exponentiation), and when some of the
work can be simplified by `evaluate()`. TinyExpr++ is slow compared to C when the
expression is long and involves only basic arithmetic.

Here is some example performance numbers taken from the included
**benchmark.cpp** program:

| Expression | evaluate time | native C time | slowdown  |
| :------------- |-------------:| -----:|----:|
| sqrt(a^1.5+a^2.5) | 16,363 ms | 13,193 ms | 24.03% slower |
| a+5 | 3,051 ms | 1,255 ms | 143.11% slower |
| a+(5*2) | 1,754 ms | 524 ms | 234.73% slower |
| (a+5)*2 | 3,225 ms | 518 ms | 522.59% slower |
| (1/(a+1)+2/(a+2)+3/(a+3)) | 12,754 ms | 680 ms | 1,775.59%  slower |

Note that TinyExpr++ is slower compared to TinyExpr because of additional type safety checks.

## Grammar

TinyExpr++ parses the following grammar:

    <list>      =    <expr> {"," <expr>}
    <expr>      =    <term> {("+" | "-") <term>}
    <term>      =    <factor> {("*" | "/" | "%") <factor>}
    <factor>    =    <power> {"^" <power>}
    <power>     =    {("-" | "+")} <base>
    <base>      =    <constant>
                   | <variable>
                   | <function-0> {"(" ")"}
                   | <function-1> <power>
                   | <function-X> "(" <expr> {"," <expr>} ")"
                   | "(" <list> ")"

In addition, whitespace between tokens is ignored.

Valid variable names consist of a lower case letter followed by any combination
of: lower case letters *a* through *z*, the digits *0* through *9*, and
underscore. Constants can be integers, decimal numbers, or in scientific
notation (e.g., *1e3* for *1000*). A leading zero is not required (e.g., *.5*
for *0.5*)

## Functions supported

TinyExpr++ supports addition (+), subtraction/negation (-), multiplication (\*),
division (/), exponentiation (^) and modulus (%) with the normal operator
precedence (the one exception being that exponentiation is evaluated
left-to-right, but this can be changed - see below).

The following C math functions are also supported:

- abs (calls to *fabs*), acos, asin, atan, atan2, ceil, cos, cosh, exp, floor, ln (calls to *log*), log (calls to *log10* by default, see below), log10, pow, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, tanh

The following functions are also built-in and provided by TinyExpr++:

- fac (factorials e.g., `fac 5` == 120)
- ncr (combinations e.g., `ncr(6,2)` == 15)
- npr (permutations e.g., `npr(6,2)` == 30)

Also, the following constants are available:

- `pi`, `e`


## Compile-time options

By default, TinyExpr++ does exponentiation from left to right. For example:

`a^b^c == (a^b)^c` and `-a^b == (-a)^b`

This is by design. It's the way that spreadsheets do it (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets).

If you would rather have exponentiation work from right to left, you need to
define `TE_POW_FROM_RIGHT` when compiling `tinyexpr.cpp`. There is a
commented-out define near the top of that file. With this option enabled, the
behaviour is:

`a^b^c == a^(b^c)` and `-a^b == -(a^b)`

That will match how many scripting languages do it (e.g., Python, Ruby).

Also, if you'd like `log` to default to the natural log instead of `log10`,
then you can define `TE_NAT_LOG`.

## Hints

- To allow constant optimization, surround constant expressions in parentheses.
  For example "x+(1+5)" will evaluate the "(1+5)" expression at compile time and
  compile the entire expression as "x+6", saving a runtime calculation. The
  parentheses are important, because TinyExpr++ will not change the order of
  evaluation. If you instead compiled "x+1+5" TinyExpr will insist that "1" is
  added to "x" first, and "5" is added the result second.
